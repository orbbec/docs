## build SDK package(.zip)
This section demonstrates how to quickly start and build SDK package on the Windows platform. The SDK version used here is [v2.4.3](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_v2/releases/tag/v2.4.3).

- First, extract the downloaded Orbbec SDK package, then navigate to the examples directory in the extracted folder and use CMake to compile the project.

Use the `ob_lidar_quick_start` sample as an introductory example to understand and use the SDK API. First, build the `ob_lidar_quick_start` sample and run it to start capturing data streams.

- Note:
 Make sure to copy the required SDK dynamic libraries(extensions & OrbbecSDK.dll) to the directory where `ob_lidar_quick_start.exe` is located.

# How to Use install package
If you do not want to compile the Orbbec SDK, you can use the SDK installation package. Taking [v2.4.8](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_v2/releases/tag/v2.4.8) as an example, first download the corresponding installation package for your platform.


- The file OrbbecSDK_vx.x.x_win64.exe serves as the installation package for the Orbbec SDK and Orbbec Viewer tools on Windows.
- The file OrbbecSDK_vx.x.x_amd64.deb serves as the installation package for the Orbbec SDK and Orbbec Viewer tools on Linux x86_64, likes ubuntu.
- The file OrbbecSDK_vx.x.x_arm64.deb serves as the installation package for the Orbbec SDK and Orbbec Viewer tools on ARM64，likes NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin , NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX , NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano , NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier , NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX.

## Install via .deb Package
- On the Linux x64 (ubuntu) platform, install using the following command. (If you are using the Arm64 platform, please use OrbbecSDK_vx.x.x_arm64.deb)
~~~
sudo dpkg -i OrbbecSDK_v2.x.x_amd64.deb
~~~
- Check the entire package path of the Orbbec SDK using dpkg -L orbbecsdk, while the header files and library files of the Orbbec SDK will be installed in the /usr/local path.
~~~
dpkg -L orbbecsdk
~~~
- Run the Orbbec Viewer.
sudo ./OrbbecViewer 

## Install via .exe Package
- On the windows platform, Double-click OrbbecSDK_vx.x.x_win64.exe directly to install, After installation is complete, run OrbbecViewer or the Orbbec SDK from the installation directory.
